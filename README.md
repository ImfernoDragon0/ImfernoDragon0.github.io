# Hi there
#
# BlackMS is starting in development. 
#
# Here is what this is about:
#
# BlackMS is a Play to Win game, where players can get free money for not even doing anything.
# We distribute Blackcoins to players for participating in the server, nomatter what you are doing in the server.
#
# But after reading all these, I'm sure many of you will run to Google to search up what exactly is Blackcoin, is it a currency in the game? Or is it some cryptocurrency? 
# Blackcoin is a cryptocurrency which can be used as real money in online transactions etc.
